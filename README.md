# angular-data-table

This is simple data-table, with search filter, sorting, and responsive feature. The table is generic and can be used to display any type of data. Sort feature can be applied to desired columns and search filter can be used and modified to filter for any column. No external package or dependency is used, features are built from scratch. It can help to get really good understanding of event binding and data manupulation in angular.
